# ImageCipher
A cryptography and steganography technique used to encrypt and decrypt plain text into an image.

<h2>How do I use this?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Install the Pillow library by running 'pip install Pillow' in your command prompt</li>
  <li>Import all the files into an IDE which supports python</li>
</ul>
<u>To encrypt</u>: 
  <ul>
      <li>Create a '.txt' file containing the message you want to encrypt. Name the file as 'msg'.</li>
      <li>Run the python files in the following order: asciiToImg.py -> publicKeyGenerator.py -> privateKeyGenerator.py -> encrypt.py</li>
      <li>The following files will be created:
        <ul>
          <li>msgImg.png : A 256x256 image that contains the ASCII values of the message that have been encoded into the RGB values of the pixels.</li>
          <li>pub.png : A random 256x256 image that gets downloaded from a url</li>
          <li>pk.png : A 256x256 image that is generated by using random values for the RGB values for each pixel</li>
          <li>enc.png : A 256x256 image which is the final encrypted image that is obtained by superimposing the above 3 images</li>
          <li>Along with the above images, 4 other files: msgimg.txt, pub.txt, pk.txt, enc.txt are also generated which contain the RGB values of each pixel of the above generated iamges respectively</li>
        </ul>
  </ul>
<u>To decrypt</u>: 
  <ul>
    <li>Save the encrypted image as 'enc.png', the public key image as 'pub.png' and the the private key image as 'pk.png'</li>
    <li>Run the python file 'decrypt.py'</li>
    <li>A new file named 'decryptedMessage.txt' will be created that will contain the decrypted message</li>
  </ul>
